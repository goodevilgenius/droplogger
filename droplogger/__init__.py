Logging application and python module.

If using as an application, you'll want to use the `droplogger` and `drop-a-log` commands.

If using as a module, you'll likely need droplogger.drop_a_log, and droplogger.config.
The droplogger.droplogger module is currently too tied to the command-line to be useful otherwise.
