# Contributing to this project

I welcome any contributions to this project.

## Issues

Please feel free to [submit issues](https://github.com/goodevilgenius/droplogger/issues/new) for any bugs you find, or features you think should be implemented.

Please bear in mind that this is a hobby project of mine. I created it primarily for my own use. If you request a feature that I don't feel would contribute much to the functionality of the application, or contradicts my intended use for the application, I will reject it. In that case, you are more than welcome to fork the project, and implement the feature yourself.

If I simply don't have time to implement a feature, I may not act on it right away, but will try to at least respond quickly (within a day or two). In that case, pull requests are welcome.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are welcome. Please bear in mind, that I use the [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) workflow. My development branch is `devel`, so all pull requests should be made off of `devel`, rather than `master`. The exception to this is any hotfixes to significant bugs, which should be based off of `master` directly.

Again, bear in mind that this project is mainly for my personal use, and if any new features in any pull requests go against my specific use, I won't accept them.

Also, this project is under an [MIT License](LICENSE), so any code accepted in a pull request will fall under that license as well.

## Code of Conduct

I have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for this project. Any comments on any issues or pull requests (or commit messages) that violate that code of conduct will be ignored and deleted.
